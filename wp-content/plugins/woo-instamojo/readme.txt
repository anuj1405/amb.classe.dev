== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Make sure you've installed the [WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) and it is activated. Note that you cannot install WooCommerce - Instamojo if you didn't install WooCommerce.
2. Search for "WooCommerce - Instamojo" on the WordPress Plugin directory or [download it](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/woo-instamojo.zip).
3. Install the plugin.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you will be able to access a new menu under settings called Instamojo.

= How to use the plugin? =

1. Now go to WooCommerce's settings tab (left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard) --> Settings --> Checkout --> Instamojo.
2. Check "Enable Instamojo Payment".
3. Now go to WooCommerce's General settings tab.
4. In WooCommerce's General settings tab make sure the currency is set to "Indian Rupee (â‚¹)".
5. Now go to your [Instamojo Dashboard](https://www.instamojo.com/dashboard).
5. Create a product by clicking on **Add a Product** on your Instamojo dashboard and choose the category **Other**.
6. Set the price to Rs. 10 and enable **"Pay what you want"**. Under **Title** and **Description**, you may enter something that describes your business and the nature of the products being sold.
7. Under **Advanced settings** of the same product there's a field **Custom Redirection URL**. Here if your website's url is **http://www.example.com** then use **http://www.example.com/?wc-api=wc_instamojo** as **Custom Redirection URL**.
8. Click on **Add Product to Store** to save the product.
9. Copy the product URL and paste this in **Instamojo Payment Link** field of the Instamojo settings page in WooCommerce. URL's format is usually: **https://www.instamojo.com/username/slug/**.
10. On the product page go to **More options** and click on **Custom Fields**. Create a custom field called **Order ID** and mark it as **required**. Click on **Add Custom Field** to save this custom field. 
11. After the custom field has been created **Existing Custom Fields** section will appear under it. Copy the name shown under **Field ID** column, its format is **Field_xxxx**, where **xxxx** are some numbers(Note that this is case sensitive!).
12. Enter this name in the **"Custom field"** field of the Instamojo settings page in WooCommerce.
13. If you prefer, you can create a Wordpress page with some custom thank you information to be shown to your customer after a successful payment. If you create such a page, you can enter the URL to this page in **"Thank You Url"** field Instamojo settings page in WooCommerce. **Note**: If you do not create such a page, then make sure this field is empty.
14. The **"Thank You Message"** will be passed with your **"Thank you URL"** as a GET parameter named **"msg"** along with another parameter named "class". So, if your **"Thank You URL"** is say **"http://www.example.com/thank-you.php"** and **"Thank You Message"** is **"Payment received"** then we will call this page as **http://www.example.com/thank-you.php/?msg=Payment+received&class=woocommerce-message**.
    The value of **class** here will be either **woocommerce-message** or **woocommerce-error** depending on whether payment was sucessful or not.
15. Save the Instamojo settings page in WooCommerce.
